This project is deprecated and wont be supported anymore!

I might rewrite it in the future in another (safer) programming language.

Please use an alternative like [libvirtd](https://libvirt.org/index.html).

# qemu-run

Quickly launch [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) virtual machines from your terminal. Without scripts, or bloated UI programs.

# How to install: Unix-like systems

For doing this, simple clone this repo, and build it, you will need tools like [git](https://git-scm.com/), a [compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

    git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:lucrnz/qemu-run.git
    cd qemu-run
    make
    sudo mv qemu-run.bin /usr/bin/qemu-run

# How to use: Making your first VM

First be sure to have [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) installed, after that we need to setup a directory where you are gonna save all your virtual machines. This are gonna be stored into an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable).
For doing this we simple edit our [bashrc](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=What%20is%20bashrc) to add this directories:

    echo "export QEMURUN_VM_PATH=\"$HOME/VM\"" >> $HOME/.bashrc

You can also specify multiple directories, by separating them by ":" , for example:

    echo "export QEMURUN_VM_PATH=\"$HOME/VM:/media/volume/VM\"" >> $HOME/.bashrc

For this simple example, let's stick with `$HOME/VM`
Now, grab yourself an ISO of any operative system you want to emulate.
For this example, we are gonna download one of the smallest GNU/Linux distros: [TinyCore](http://www.tinycorelinux.net/).

    cd $HOME/VM
    mkdir tinycore
    cd tinycore
    wget http://www.tinycorelinux.net/12.x/x86/release/TinyCore-current.iso -O tinycore.iso
    echo "sys=x32" > config.ini # Initialize the VM config file.
    echo "cdrom=tinycore.iso" >> config.ini
    qemu-run tinycore

You should be see Tiny Core Linux booting up ðŸ˜ƒ

If you need a hard drive (for example, you are installing a GNU/Linux like Debian)

    qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.qcow2 64G # Replace the size as you like.
